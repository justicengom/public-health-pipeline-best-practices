## Overview

The field of public health bioinformatics relies heavily on the development and sustainability of high-quality software to support efforts in disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, and genomic research. Bioinformatics pipelines, also known as bioinformatics workflows, play a critical role in facilitating the routine analysis of genomic data by orchestrating the flow from raw data through various processing stages to final analysis and reporting. 

Despite their critical role, the absence of guidelines and best practices specific to public health pathogen genomics has hindered progress towards accessible, reproducible, interoperable, and standardized bioinformatics analysis in public health.

To support both pipeline developers and analysts who rely on these pipelines to inform critical public health decision making, the Bioinformatics Pipelines and Visualization Working Group of the Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE) has proposed a set of best practices for bioinformatics pipelines, tailored for public health applications. These best practices aim to provide a framework for the development, testing, and maintenance of bioinformatics pipelines, enhancing the quality, reliability, and sustainability of these resources and facilitating their impact on public health.
